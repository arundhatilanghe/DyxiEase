# Coping-with-Dyslexia

Dyslexia is a specific language disorder that causes problem in reading, writing and speaking. It is neurobiological in origin. It is characterized by poor word recognition, spelling and decoding abilities despite having higher cognitive abilities and receiving effective classroom experience.

It can be estimated that teachers will have between one and five dyslexic students in each class. If left untreated, dyslexics will develop low self-esteem and poor confidence.
Some researchers claimed it to be just a visual issue. Studies found children with dyslexia and without dyslexia to have
similar visual conditions.

# Proposed Solution

An easily available, less expensive and safe online tool for dyslexics.
We made an android application for dyslexics.
